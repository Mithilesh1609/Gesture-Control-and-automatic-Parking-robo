# Gesture-Control-and-automatic-Parking-robo
This robo is run on the base of **hand gesture,** when you want to identify the parking space and park the car it does that by its own.
the hand gesture part is done using **accelorometer(ADXL355) sensor** and the parking part is done using **ultrasonic sensors,** in order to do this we have used one **ardiuno mega and one ardiuno uno.**
